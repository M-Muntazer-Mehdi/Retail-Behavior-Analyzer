# Retail-Behavior-Analyzer

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior for the electronics section of Imtiaz Mall. The analysis focuses on data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clustering using various algorithms. The aim is to identify distinct customer segments and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing customer retention and sales growth.

## Repository Structure

- **imtiaz store analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook includes the complete analysis workflow, covering data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis, and clustering using K-Means, DBSCAN, and K-Means++ algorithms.
- **Conclusion Report.docx**: A detailed report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including comparisons of clustering results, key insights, and strategic recommendations.

## Modules

### Module 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Download historical sales data for the electronics section.
   - Ensure data includes customer demographics, purchase history, product details, spending amounts, and transaction dates.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Address outliers and inconsistencies in data format and encoding.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Create new features to enhance insights into customer behavior, such as average spending, purchase frequency, brand affinity, and product category preferences.
   - Standardize or normalize numeric features for clustering algorithms.

### Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Analyze the distribution of key features using histograms, boxplots, and descriptive statistics.

2. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Explore relationships between features using scatterplots and heatmaps.

3. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Analyze trends and seasonal variations in customer behavior over time.

### Module 3: Clustering Analysis

A. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using elbow plot and silhouette analysis.
   - Apply K-Means algorithm and analyze cluster characteristics.

B. **DBSCAN Clustering:**
   - Define `eps` and `MinPts` parameters and experiment with different values.
   - Apply DBSCAN algorithm and compare clusters with those from K-Means.

C. **K-Means++ Clustering:**
   - Implement K-Means++ for improved clustering performance.
   - Compare results with K-Means and evaluate cluster quality.

### Module 4: Comparison and Conclusion

1. **Comparison of Clustering Algorithms:**
   - Analyze similarities and differences in clusters formed by K-Means, DBSCAN, and K-Means++.
   - Evaluate effectiveness using metrics like silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz score, and Davies-Bouldin index.

2. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - Provide insights into customer segments and purchasing behavior.
   - Recommend strategies for customer retention, personalized recommendations, targeted marketing, and loyalty programs.
   - Suggest further analysis to optimize performance.
